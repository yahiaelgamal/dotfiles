description: Create a git commit with a well-formed message
---

- Before committing, double check if changes are needed to be done in CLAUDE.md
- Always have separate commits for each logical change. Make the commit message concise and clear. The only code relevant code and normal.
- After each comment I want you to tell me what comments you did.
