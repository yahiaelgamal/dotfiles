name: execute_plan
description: Execute a previously written plan
---

take an argument which plan you want to execute. Confirm with me which model you want to use. And then go ahead and execute the plan.

After executing the plan, always write a report with the same name as the plan. And a post-fix of the report.

Make sure that you know how to verify the output.

In that report you should highlight any difference you had between the original plan and the extra execution.

Use the /commit command for committing

## CRITICAL: Documentation Updates

**MANDATORY STEP - DO NOT SKIP:**
After implementing any significant changes (new features, refactoring, API changes, testing infrastructure, etc.), you MUST update CLAUDE.md to reflect these changes. This is not optional.

Documentation updates should include:
- New commands, features, or workflows added
- Testing instructions if tests were added/modified
- Architecture changes if structure was modified
- Development requirements if tooling changed
- Updated examples if usage patterns changed

Add "Update CLAUDE.md" as a task in your todo list at the START of plan execution, not as an afterthought.
